			<h1>A Musical Adventure with Acoustic Guitar</h1>
			<h3>By Chris Coraggio</h3>
			<p>This is in no way a complete dissertation on all that acoustic guitar or music in general has to offer; rather I hope that this is a good starting block for the musically curious. I wrote this as a tool mainly for my church back home, so certain sections pertain more to Christian music and worship leading than others, but it is my hope that any reader can glean something out of this.</p>

			<h2>Step 1: Open Chords</h2>
			<p>This step is arguably the most grueling, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. You just have to memorize all of these chords. The numbers are for your fingers: Index is 1, Middle is 2, Ring is 3, Pinky is 4. If a string doesn&rsquo;t have an open circle on top of it or a number on it, you don&rsquo;t strum that string when you play the chord. Try to get to where you can play most of the chords without looking at the paper before you move on to the next step. If you&rsquo;re getting a fuzzy sound (like I did a lot when I started), don&rsquo;t give up: often you just have to move your wrist up a bit more and ensure your fingers are only hitting one string. By the way, the little m&rsquo;s next to some of the letters indicate a <em>minor</em> chord &ndash; more on what that means in Step 3.</p>

			</div>

			<h2>Step 1.5: A Few More Chords</h2>
			<p>So that last picture missed out on a few things. If you loved Step 1, master these chords before you head onto Step 2. Most likely, though, this is okay to skip. For G and Em, there are other shapes (finger positions) than what you just learned. The difference is in the sound; the previous shapes have a more open structure, making the Em sound sadder and the G sound not as rock-y. This is not a bad thing, but for my playing, I typically use the following shapes.</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<div class="image-holder">
						<img src="images/em.jpg"></img>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<div class="image-holder">
						<img src="images/gALT.jpg"></img>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Also, there&rsquo;s one chord that breaks the rules of fingers only hitting one string (for now): The F chord requires you to grab two with your pointer finger, so I put it in this section because it might need some extra practice. If you really don&rsquo;t like this shape, there&rsquo;s a better one in step 4, but I still use this one so there&rsquo;s no shame in learning and using it.</p>

			</div>

			<h2>Step 2: Progressions</h2>
			<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to put those chords you learned to work. Without getting too theoretical, there are a couple of sequences of chords that you&rsquo;ll find in pop/rock music, so nailing these will solidify your chord knowledge, teach you fluidity, and give you a leg up when you jump into actual songs. Repeat these sequences with whatever strumming you like, starting at a slow tempo for comfort and speeding up as you&rsquo;re able to. Try to pick a tempo where you can consistently hit each chord on the downbeat. Each chord goes for four beats. Notice you get some bonus progressions for looking at step 1.5! If you get good at the other three, do the two with the F chord for funsies.</p>
			<p>G &ndash; C &ndash; D &ndash; G</p>
			<p>D &ndash; G &ndash; A &ndash; D</p>
			<p>C &ndash; F &ndash; G &ndash; C (if you read step 1.5)</p>
			<p>G &ndash; D &ndash; Em &ndash; C</p>
			<p>C &ndash; G &ndash; Am &ndash; F (if you read step 1.5)</p>

			<h2>Step 2.5: Actual songs</h2>
			<p>This is for your own satisfaction &ndash; Many of the chords and progressions you just learned can be applied to songs you already know! Christian songs like Chris Tomlin&rsquo;s <em>How Great is our God</em> or pop songs like Vance Joy&rsquo;s <em>Riptide</em> are built on three or four chords! I recommend Ultimate Guitar Tabs as a good resource (the phone app is worth your money and the online version is free) &ndash; take a look at some of your favorite songs and play a couple of them along with the track. If you come across numbers and slashes you haven&rsquo;t seen before, take a look at step 3 for how to handle them, or just skip them. If you come across chords you haven&rsquo;t seen before, try another song and wait until you&rsquo;ve gotten to step 4. This stage is meant to be exploratory and simple.</p>


			<h2>Step 3: Chord Structure and Extensions</h2>
			<p>First thing first, you&rsquo;ve heard a major scale. Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So... You get the idea. It sounds pretty and it&rsquo;s standard. But scales are the fundamental components of chords, so we&rsquo;re going to get theoretical and break down some of this stuff. If you get lost, see my note at the end. A C major scale goes like this:</p>
			<p>C &ndash; D &ndash; E &ndash; F &ndash; G &ndash; A &ndash; B &ndash; C</p>
			<p>1 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 3 &ndash; 4 &ndash; 5 &ndash; 6 &ndash; 7 &ndash; 8 (1)</p>
			<p>The numbers below refer to the <em>degree</em>, or the number in the scale sequence. For instance, E is the third scale degree, and G is the fifth. The eighth is the same note as the first, but an octave higher, so you could call it whichever I suppose.</p>
			<p>Chords, like I said, are built on scales. So if we wanted a C major chord, we would use the 1, 3, and 5 degrees of the C major scale. This particular combination (1-3-5) is called a <em>triad</em>, and it&rsquo;s pretty much all you&rsquo;re going to play at a basic level. So what about minor chords? They use a minor triad based on the minor scale (as there are three I&rsquo;m going to skip them), which basically amount to the third of the major triad being one half-step lower, or <em>flattened</em>. For instance, whereas a C triad is C-E-G, a Cm triad is C-Eb-G.</p>
			<p>Did you see some funny numbers next to a C or a G while you were looking at real songs? These things are called extensions, and they add some extra spice to a chord. I&rsquo;ll give my own theoretical definition of most of the extensions you&rsquo;ll come across, along with my own musical idea of their function. This means that it is up to you to Google these chord shapes if you&rsquo;re intent on playing them exactly right. If you come across extra numbers in your chord, though, 9 times out of 10, <em>you can completely ignore them and be just fine</em>. Here&rsquo;s some of what you&rsquo;ll see, using C as an example:</p>
			<p><strong>C2 or Cadd9</strong> (C2 is more popular but theoretically incorrect): Adds the second scale degree, makes the chord sound a little denser but still pleasing to the ear. C-E-G-D</p>
			<p><strong>Csus4 or Csus</strong>: Takes out the third and replaces it with the fourth, makes the chord sound floaty. C-F-G</p>
			<p><strong>C5: </strong>Often called the <em>power chord</em>, this chord is just the first and fifth, making for a rock sound. C-G-C</p>
			<p><strong>C6</strong>: Adds the sixth scale degree, similar effect to Cadd9. C-E-G-A</p>
			<p><strong>Cmaj7</strong>: Adds the major seventh (the one naturally in the scale), creates dissonance for a deeper, sadder, or creepier chord depending on context. C-E-G-B</p>
			<p><strong>C7</strong>: Adds the <em>dominant</em> seventh (one half-step lower than the major seventh), creates a need for resolution. A very tense chord. Trying playing C7 then F and you&rsquo;ll see the point, though. C-E-G-Bb</p>
			<p>Now what if you see something like <strong>Csus4/G</strong>? It&rsquo;s the same as above, except with an <em>inversion</em>; the note after the slash (G in this case) is now the lowest note instead of C. This example would be G-C-F-G</p>
			<p>In summary, not much of this theory knowledge is actually necessary to play the right chords, but to save you time and confusion, I&rsquo;ve included it. If it&rsquo;s not your style, ignore the numbers and slashes and plow through or just memorize the chord shapes. Hopefully if you read this section, though, you have a better idea of what it all means behind the scenes.</p>

			<h2>Step 4: Barre Chords and Capos</h2>
			<p>What the heck, Chris? I just read the first three chapters and I still don&rsquo;t know how to play Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, or F#! How am I going to play my favorite songs? This leads to the all-important topic of <em>transposition</em>, the idea of changing a song&rsquo;s key. A song&rsquo;s key has to do with what scale the song uses; for instance, if a song included G, D, Em, and C chords, that song is most likely in G (it could also be in Em because G and Em use the same scale, but most songs use major tonality) because all its chords use notes in the G major scale.</p>
			<p>So let&rsquo;s do the easy thing first; a capo is a fun little attachment that changes the key of your guitar. Basically wherever you put the capo becomes the new top of the guitar. So putting a capo on the first fret of a standard-tuned guitar would make the strings sound F-Bb-Eb-Ab-C-F, one half-step above the standard. In a similar fashion, if you played a G chord with the capo on the first fret, it would come out as an Ab chord, one half-step above a G chord. Capos are great for adjusting on the fly to different vocal keys and are a must-have for any acoustic guitar player.</p>
			<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have a song in the key of Ab with a progression something to the effect of Ab &ndash; Eb &ndash; Fm &ndash; Db. Scary, right? We don&rsquo;t know all of those chords yet, and if you read the back half of this step and came back to it, you still wouldn&rsquo;t want to play this progression without a capo. So let&rsquo;s slap a capo on the first fret and play G-D-Em-C. Much better. Now the cool thing about Ultimate Guitar Tabs is that you can change the key or transpose the song. So you can actually change the text to display the song in the key of G, play chords in the key of G, and have it sound in the key of Ab because of the capo. The moral of the story is that if you see songs in awful keys like Ab or F#, instead of running away, just transpose it down and figure out where to put the capo.</p>
			<p>But what if I&rsquo;ve got a song in, say, the key of D that goes like D &ndash; A &ndash; Bm &ndash; G? I know three of those chords, but it&rsquo;s just the one that really bothering me. Transposing it down to G and putting a capo on the seventh fret may get you the technically right chords, but a capo past five makes the guitar sound silly. So we are going to have to use the barre chord, in essence making our pointer finger a temporary capo.</p>
			<p>For the actual mechanics of barring, the Internet is much wiser than I on the subject. However, once you&rsquo;ve searched it out and figured out how to barre, the rest of the chords you&rsquo;ll need to use employ the same shapes as the chords you&rsquo;ve already learned. If you want to play an F chord, for instance, and you hate the way I showed you in step 1.5, you can just play an E chord while barring the first fret. If you want to play the F# chord that you&rsquo;ve always dreamed about, play that same E chord while barring the second fret. And so on and so forth. As a recommendation, don&rsquo;t barre beyond the fourth fret (relative to capo) &ndash; most of the time that means you&rsquo;ll be moving around a lot. Typically, if you feel you need to do that, it would be easier to transpose the song down and grab a capo.</p>
			<p>Remember that once you&rsquo;ve got barring down, it&rsquo;s a good idea to try some new progressions to gain fluidity with the barre. Try these on for size:</p>
			<p>E &ndash; B &ndash; C#m &ndash; A</p>
			<p>F &ndash; Bb &ndash; C &ndash; F (try F with and without the barre)</p>

			<h2>Step 4.5: Actual songs again!</h2>
			<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with barring and good at transposing, you can play pretty much any song you want. There are a couple more chord types and extensions that are beyond the scope of this introductory process, but you should be able to play whatever you want. Take some time to explore!</p>

			<h2>Step 5: Strumming</h2>
			<p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about strumming &ndash; I&rsquo;ve improvised every strum pattern I&rsquo;ve played based off of how the song sounds. But if you&rsquo;re having trouble with a consistent strum pattern, try a couple staple Christian songs and YouTube them for their strum patterns. Once you&rsquo;ve got a few under your belt, you&rsquo;ll probably be able to use them across multiple songs. I wish I had more to offer you from my experience, but strumming is such a technical skill that it&rsquo;d be better-explained and more easily replicated if you simply turned to the Internet.</p>

			<h2>Step 6: Dynamics and Song Structure</h2>
			<p>Songs (especially worship songs) follow a very similar format. Consider Verses, Choruses, Bridges, Prechoruses, Intros, Instrumentals, and Tags to be the standard building blocks of songs. Many follow something along the lines of Intro, V1, PC, C, Instrumental, V2, PC, C, Br, C, Tag. Most of these are entirely self-explanatory, but I&rsquo;ll explain tag for the unfamiliar: a tag is a special or modified piece typically ending a song. It might take the last line of the chorus and repeat it (as in Matt Redman&rsquo;s <em>Ten Thousand Reasons)</em>, or it might introduce some new lyrics or chords to end the song.</p>
			<p>Why worry about how a song is constructed? Because it gives you clues on how to play it musically. If we played everything with the same volume and the same strum pattern, life would get boring. So here&rsquo;s a breakdown of that standard song and how I would play it. This will vary by song, and is by no means etched in stone, but it should provide you with some idea of how to make a song more musical throughout.</p>

			<p><strong>Intro</strong>: Standard volume, bringing out the melodic (recognizable) line</p>
			<p><strong>V1</strong>: Soft-ish, let the vocals lead. This is what establishes the song if there&rsquo;s no recognizable intro.</p>
			<p><strong>PC</strong>: Building. Pre-chorus builds to the chorus lyrically, so it should do the same musically. Push the dynamics a little on the last few beats.</p>
			<p><strong>C</strong>: This is just the first chorus, so don&rsquo;t go crazy, but it does need to be full.</p>
			<p><strong>Instrumental</strong>: Dial it back down to the verse</p>
			<p><strong>Second Pass Through (V2, PC, C):</strong> The verse is typically more involved, the prechorus and chorus are basically the same.</p>
			<p><strong>Bridge</strong>: This often repeats, starting as the least involved you&rsquo;ve been yet and going to a reasonable maximum by the last iteration. This specific part is largely dependent on the specific song, but it can be the climax of the music by the end.</p>
			<p><strong>Outro/Tag</strong>: Reasonably fade as required by the vocals. Make sure it&rsquo;s loud enough to where those singing are comfortable doing so.</p>

			<h2>Step 7: Pat Yourself on the Back</h2>
			<p>You made it; you&rsquo;re an acoustic guitar player! This isn&rsquo;t the end of the road, though; continue to seek out new information as you approach stuff you haven&rsquo;t done before. Check out different scale patterns, figure out fingerpicking, dive into some tasteful hammer-ons, etc. The choice is yours. If you need any further guidance, or have questions about the material written here, contact me below, and I would be happy to help you out. I hope you use these newfound skills in lifting up Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
<!--
			<h2>Step 8: Progression Theory</h2>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve included this as an added section because it is not essential to your success, but it is pretty helpful in deciding what tabs are bad or sound weird and why. If you really get this section down, you can probably start figuring out songs by ear, since you will have narrowed down the bank of chords from which you can pick. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of a couple of the most basic chord progressions (from step 1.5):</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-6">
					<p>G &ndash; D &ndash; Em &ndash; C:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, V, vi, IV</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-6">
					<p>G &ndash; C &ndash; D - G:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, IV, V, I</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Why the roman numerals? It&rsquo;s just how we denote chords. The lowercase is reserved for minor chords. If you&rsquo;ll notice, the numbers correspond with the degree of the scale (G major, since we&rsquo;re in the key of G) that the chords start on.</p>
